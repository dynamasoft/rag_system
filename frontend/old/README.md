# RAG System Frontend

This directory contains the frontend part of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System. The frontend is built using React and provides an interactive user interface for querying the system.

## Key Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can input queries to retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base.
- **AI-Generated Responses**: The system integrates with a large language model (LLM) to generate answers based on the retrieved context.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to be user-friendly and responsive across different devices.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following command to install the required packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Folder Structure

- `src/pages`: Contains the main pages of the application, including the Home page.
- `src/App.jsx`: The main application component that sets up routing.
