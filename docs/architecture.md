# Architecture Overview of the RAG System

## Introduction
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System is designed to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 by integrating document search and retrieval functionalities. This document outlines the architecture of the system, detailing the interactions between its components.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend
- **Technology**: React
- **Description**: The frontend provides an interactive user interface for users to input queries and receive AI-generated responses. It consists of several components:
  - **SearchBar**: A component that captures user input and triggers search queries.
  - **Home Page**: The main page that integrates the SearchBar and displays results.

### 2. Backend
- **Technology**: FastAPI
- **Description**: The backend handles query processing, document retrieval, and response generation. Key components include:
  - **Main Application**: Initializes the FastAPI app and sets up middleware and routes.
  - **API Endpoints**: Defines the endpoints for handling incoming requests and returning responses.
  - **Document Model**: Represents the structure of documents used in the retrieval system.
  - **Retrieval Service**: Implements the logic for retrieving documents using FAISS, a vector database.
  - **Generation Service**: Integrates with the LLM (GPT-4) to generate responses based on the context retrieved.

### 3. Document Storage
- **Technology**: FAISS (or alternatives like Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB)
- **Description**: The system uses a vector database to store and retrieve documents efficiently. FAISS is utilized for its speed and scalability in handling large datasets.

## Workflow
1. **User Input**: The user enters a query in the SearchBar.
2. **Query Processing**: The frontend sends the query to the backend API.
3. **Document Retrieval**: The backend retrieves relevant documents from the vector database using the Retrieval Service.
4. **Response Generation**: The retrieved context is passed to the Generation Service, which queries the LLM to generate a response.
5. **Display Results**: The generated response is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

## Scalability and Customization
The architecture is designed to be scalable and customizable. Users can integrate different vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB) based on their requirements, ensuring flexibility in deployment.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a robust framework for building a RAG system that leverages the strengths of LLMs and document retrieval technologies, resulting in accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries.
